# ACS-4210-makeutility
Provided a dictory, this program will create a report on the file space for each directory and print it out on the console. The report will include the name of the directory and the total file space.

## Getting Started
```bash
go run utility.go <directory>
```
`directory` is the directory you want to get the file space report for. It is optional and the default is the current directory.
